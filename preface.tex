This report is a result of the specialization project in the fifth year of the Master of Science program in Electronics, with specialization in Design of Digital Systems, at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication (IET) at the \gls{ntnu}. 

\noindent
The work leading to this report was conducted in the autumn of 2015. This specific project with the title "High-Level Synthesis for Hardware Architectural Exploration" was proposed by the company Nordic Semiconductor ASA in Trondheim, during my summer internship with them in the summer of 2015. I found the subject of High-Level Synthesis interesting, due to my specialization courses at \gls{ntnu} being within digital hardware design and embedded real-time systems design. Throughout the working period with the project, Nordic Semiconductor have provided me with a workplace and computer equipment with access to their design-tools and other useful resources. I am grateful for the equipment and help I have been given, which were necessary to complete this project.

\noindent
I would like to thank my supervisors Isael Diaz at Nordic Semiconductor and professor Kjetil Svarstad from NTNU, for their guidance, support and feedback through this project.
