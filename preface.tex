\noindent
This report is the result of the Master's thesis conducted during the spring of 2016, concluding a Master of Science degree in Electronics, Design of Digital Systems. The report is submitted to the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

\noindent
This work is a continuation of a specialization project conducted during the autumn of 2015. The project was proposed by Nordic Semiconductor in August 2015, and the continuation into a Master's thesis was a natural choice in January 2016. During the work with this thesis, I have learned a lot about the concept of high-level synthesis and how to implement integrated circuits, all the way from the planning stage until final layout.

\noindent
I would like to thank my supervisors Isael Diaz at Nordic Semiconductor and professor Kjetil Svarstad from NTNU, for their guidance, support and feedback through this project. Finally, I want to thank my family and friends for their support, encouragement and inspirational discussions during this work and through the whole degree.
