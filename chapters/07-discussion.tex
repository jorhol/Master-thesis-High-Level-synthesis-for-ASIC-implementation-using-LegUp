\section{Advances in LegUp since last release}
From the GIT repository of LegUp, it can be seen that many new features have been and still are being implemented for the next release version of LegUp. The current version (4.0), were released in August 2015. One of the more interesting features from the views of this project is the implementation of streaming inputs and outputs. Even though this has been implemented in this project as well, the native implementation can be more thoroughly tested and have more functionality than the one implemented here. However, it is still uncertain if a way of producing multiple output-signals have been implemented.

    Added member variable "isExternalRAM" to indicate if a RAM exists
    outside the circuit and is not to be created inside (say for a pointer
    that is passed in as an argument into the top-level function).
